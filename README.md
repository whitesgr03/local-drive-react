## Description:

Rokulezrive is a file uploader built as a stripped down version of Google Drive. Allows users to upload, download and share files.

### Technologies:  

1. [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) to keep the user interface in sync with the URL. In addition, it allows defining which component to display for a specified URL.

2. [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) to validate any form's data and make sure that it matches the schemas that define how the data should look and the values expected to conform to them.

### Additional info:

At first I planned to use Passport.js to build an authentication system, but I'm new to user email validation and token expiration handling, so I decided to use the auth provider Supabase for authentication and authorization.

Cloudinary is currently used to store user files and may be changed to Supabase Storage in the future for convenience to manage together with database and auth services.
